### Editor + Terminal

- I was late on the VSCode bandwagon, but have been using it for several years now.
- Themes: I switch between several themes depending on the season and how I'm feeling. Generally, I use Nord Deep in the winter, Cobalt2 in the spring, Summer Night in the summer, and Rouge in autumn. Cobalt2 tends to be my default when I switch it up.
- Favorite extensions: Quokka, Prettier, Copilot
- I'm currently using [Jetbrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) as my font.
- Brave is my main browser.
- I currently use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) for my terminal, but I've been reaching for [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) more often recently.

### Desktop Apps

- Raycast
- Todoist
- Linear
- Figma/Figjam
- Notion
- Loom

### Desk Setup

- Razer Kiyo Pro webcam
- HyperX Quadcast X microphone
- Dell P2720DC monitor with USB
- I stand for almost every meeting, but jump between sitting and standing a few times throughout the day. I'm currently just using an old wicker barstool. A proper, ergonomic work stool is my next big work-related purchase.
- My desk is the top of an old Ikea desk, sitting on a Fully motorized standing desk
- I currently use a Macbook Air M1 with 16 GB ram

### Automation

- My house runs on a Home Assistant server with quite a few custom flows through Node RED. The lighting (brightness and color temperature) and climate in my office is automated based on time of day, office occupancy, whether my girlfriend is in the house.
