## What I do

I bring products to life through product leadership, full-stack development, and human-centered design. Currently, I work as the Product Lead at Interobang, where I have the opportunity to test, prototype, and build products through the early stages of market adoption.

The road to get here has been meandering, but with two common threads: the importance of being able to “connect the dots” to build strategies that succeed and the ability to utilize my technical skill set to help build ideas and streamline processes.

Over the years, my titles and roles have covered several focus areas. I continually switch between development and strategy, even within the same job. At Cast & Hue, my title switch from Strategist to Analyst was long after I started building novel first-party analysis tools and new digital product deliverables. At Interobang, I switch between a development and product management role on a regular basis and I’m agile in both.

I love learning and I’m fueled by quickly changing environments where I’m challenged to adapt quickly through innovation, ideation, and the pursuit of new knowledge. This has been a theme throughout my career; especially on the development side. I developed my first website in high school by reverse-engineering a site I admired and rebuilding it in Wordpress. While I’ve never had formal development training, I’m now at a point where I’m adept across a broad range of skills, ranging from React to complex event-driven architecture design.

My professional passions exist at the intersection of emerging technologies, human-centered design, and the humanization of technology. I’m inspired by projects that seek to rediscover balance - balance within the natural world, balance within the human condition, and balance with technology. I have a particular interest in productivity tools and how the right tools and culture can bring thoughtfulness and balance back to the workplace.

Outside of work, I like to step away from the computer and get outside! I enjoy gardening, hiking, cross-country skiing, camping, and backpacking. I’m also a big fan of Goruck and participate in a couple of events each year. It’s great for both physical endurance testing and building leadership skills.
